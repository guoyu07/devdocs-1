        <link href="https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/10/23/meetnext-a-recap"/>
        <updated>2017-10-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/10/23/meetnext-a-recap</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="/blog/img/2017-10-23-meetnext-recap/cody_army.jpg"><img src="/blog/img/2017-10-23-meetnext-recap/cody_army_thumb.jpg" alt="Army of Codys" /></a></p>

<h2>When</h2>

<p>#MeetNext took place from October 18th to 20th</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p><a href="/blog/img/2017-10-23-meetnext-recap/campus_view.jpg"><img src="/blog/img/2017-10-23-meetnext-recap/campus_view_thumb.jpg" alt="Germania Campus" /></a></p>

<p>Münster, Germany</p>

<h2>What</h2>

<p>The participants were informed about the current state of the Shopware research.</p>

<p>So, what is the <code>Next</code> in #MeetNext about? In a nutshell, it is the next big thing. A completely new product different to 5.x which will be developed simultaneously to Shopware 5. They will both receive patches and new features. Which leads us to the next question:</p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>Shopware is a well established, mature product. As the people who are working with Shopware know, there are a lot of things in the software that work in a certain way because it is our legacy. And we can't change it without effectively breaking the functionality of almost every plugin out there. Example: Ever wondered why products are called <code>articles</code> in shopware? Because the german word for a product is <code>Artikel</code>. Ever wondered why there are multiple terms for manufacturer? Legacy. So yeah, that's not what we want and of course there's much more, especially regarding the architecture.</p>

<p>So the main reason is: We want to continue to make Shopware better, faster, ready for the future and easier to develop for. To achieve this, we have to break a lot of stuff, and we don't want to throw away all the work we and you guys out there already invested. We're always telling you, like a mantra, that we love our community. Guess what, we do this because we mean it. You're part of Shopware and we wouldn't want to have a different community.</p>

<p>All that said, we want to create a second version of Shopware which only carries the good part of our legacy. We don't want to do this in the dark, doing the jack-in-the-box at some time and presenting the new and shiny brother of Shopware 5. We want to have you aboard as soon as possible. We want to hear from you if the things we are planning and implementing are what you need in the end. We want to hear what you think is a mistake, what we forgot and what is even more awesome than before.</p>

<p>The #MeetNext was the first feedback event and it was, marketing speak aside, a huge success. Before we dive in, always remember you can see for yourself what is happening, either on <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/tree/labs">github</a> or in the <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/labs/">documentation</a>.</p>

<h1>Hacking</h1>

<p>After the sessions ended, a lot of the participants started hacking and tried to break things.</p>

<p>Since we didn't manage to memorize (or write down) the names of all hackers and their projects, here is a list of examples in no particular order and without credit. But the list shows two things, first how awesome Shopware next will be (short time, great projects) and how awesome the Shopware community is. Especially you guys who managed to attend #MeetNext. ;-)</p>

<h2>Some of the &quot;hack projects&quot;</h2>

<ul>
<li>Implement reactive window management in vue.js</li>
<li>Tracing library for class performance analysis</li>
<li>Port an existing cart-related plugin to Next</li>
<li>Revive the old ExtJS backend and let it speak to the new API</li>
<li>Create a different concept of component extension for vue.js</li>
</ul>

<h1>Visual Impressions</h1>

        <link href="https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/09/29/shopware-goes-gitter"/>
        <updated>2017-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/09/29/shopware-goes-gitter</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>A huge change for the community</h2>

<p>For several years now, since 2011 to be precise, there is a small but vibrant chat community on freenode in the #shopware channel.</p>

<p>All these people chatting there have one thing in common, they are working on the Shopware ecommerce system, in one way or the other.</p>

<p>Now these times will be over. As of the end of October 2017, the IRC channel will be closed.
If you hear a faint scream in the distance it may be one of the guys from the IRC channel who is just reading this post as you do now.</p>

<p><strong><strong>But!</strong></strong> of course we will not leave you alone in the dark. And we are not closing the IRC channel because we don't like people chatting.
In fact, we love your passion for shopware and we want to communicate with you and we want you to have a platform where you can communicate directly to other people involved with Shopware.</p>

<p>So, why the change? What changes? What are the consequences? Just read further, friend, and find out.</p>

<h2>What will change?</h2>

<p>For a short period of time (read: one month) the IRC channel will stay open. During this period we will actively transfer people to <a href="https://gitter.im/shopware/shopware">Gitter</a>.</p>

<p>After this, the IRC channel will be closed and all chat activity will take place on Gitter.</p>

<p>If you are an IRC user by now, you can use your client for Gitter as well, just follow the steps mentioned at the end of the <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/contributing/gitter">contribution page</a>.
Of course we encourage you to use the clients provided by Gitter, since most IRC clients don't handle markdown that well.</p>

<p>Since there are a lot of german users, those will find a german channel to make their lifes easier.</p>

<p>If you are new to the show, just <a href="https://gitter.im/shopware/shopware?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge"><img src="https://badges.gitter.im/shopware/shopware.svg" alt="Gitter" /></a>!</p>

<h2>What is Gitter?</h2>

<p>In case you are new to this, Gitter is a free, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp">open source</a> chat where you login with your github or twitter account and are able to chat immediatly.
Like IRC, but with more features and more or less integrated with our github repository. Like Slack, but more community-centric.</p>

<p>If you want to know the full story, there is a nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitter">wikipedia article</a> about the service.</p>

<p><em>One of the biggest changes for former IRC users:</em> Gitter chatrooms are public and save history indefinitely. So everything you say is wisdom for eternity.
Or embarrassment, but this is an unusual state of mind for shopware enthusiasts. So be careful. There be dragons. On the other hand, you don't need that icky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)">bouncer</a> anymore. ;)</p>

<h2>But... why?</h2>

<p>To cite the devdocs <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/contributing/irc">irc page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2011, the shopware IRC channel was active and well established.<br />
Today, IRC is a little bit nerdy and we really love it. Most of the cool kids are playing on freenode.</p>
<p>But besides the coolness there are a few disadvantages that come with using IRC:</p>
<ul>
<li>No history without 3rd party software</li>
<li>No mapping between the contributor and the IRC nick (Who is xenomorph again?)</li>
<li>No easy access except through anonymous web IRC clients</li>
<li>Lacks modern features like image sharing, formatting and such</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, all these points are arguable.<br />
But in the end, we wanted to have a chat community with easier access and more modern features.</p>
<p>We hope to not lose any old IRC users (we learned to love you all at #shopware) and get many new and interesting people to join <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/contributing/gitter">Gitter</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The transition</h2>

<p>First step is, the IRC channels will get +m and +s and all users will get a message similar to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come join us and <a href="https://gitter.im/shopware/shopware?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge"><img src="https://badges.gitter.im/shopware/shopware.svg" alt="Gitter" /></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From then on, every user who joins the IRC channel will automatically be notified of the new situation.</p>

<p>After one month, the channel will become invite only.</p>

        <link href="https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/09/25/ajax-panel"/>
        <updated>2017-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/09/25/ajax-panel</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post I want to present the concept of our ajax based panel system which we use in our B2B-Suite.
In the B2B-Suite we had to develop a backend user interface inside the Shopware frontend.</p>

<p>On a single page in a typical backend view you may find:</p>

<ul>
<li>list of entities</li>
<li>form to enter new data</li>
<li>list of related entities</li>
<li>some statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>Serving all this data from a single controller action may already be hard, now imagine the sheer number of parameters you may
have to exchange with this single action when you want to enable pagination, validation and searching on this single page,
through this single action.</p>

<p>This is pretty much the reason why stateless services and statefull frontends are an important topic in todays web development.
And it is exactly the reason why we created the ajax panel. It provides us with the means to load local states from the
server and create a rich ui.</p>

<p>We evaluated different frameworks to achieve this target. AngularJS and Vue.JS were possible frameworks which allows
two way data binding and statefull frontend access.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/ajax-panel-abstract.svg" alt="image"></p>

<p>The small controller actions don't respond with the full page dom tree anymore. Each controller is only responsible for a
specific panel content.</p>

<p>One ouf our targets was also to use most of the already existing dependencies instead of adding new frameworks just for
the B2B-Suite. We use jQuery because it is a base dependency of Shopware 5.</p>

<p>We decided to develop our own lightweight frontend framework on top of jQuery which allows asynchronous HTTP requests for our frontend.
The main target of this framework is to execute asynchronous calls and render the response in a given and zoned DOM element by using an event.
The behaviour is very similar to angular's <a href="https://github.com/angular/zone.js">zone.js</a>.</p>

<h2>Code Example</h2>

<p>The base structure of our ajax panel index action looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;ajax-panel&quot; data-url=&quot;http://domain.tld/ajax-panel-controller&quot; data-id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On page load our jQuery ajax panel plugin will search for the class <code>ajax-panel</code> and use the data attribute <code>data-url</code>.
If this attribute contains a valid url the jQuery plugin will perform an asynchronous http request on the attribute url.
If the response is signed with a HTTP Status Code of 200 the response will be rendered back in the original zoned div with the data-id <code>example</code>.</p>

<h2>Response Example</h2>

<p>The ajax panel controller action responds with the content of the ajax panel element and moves the dom structure inside the given element.
The response could be like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;span&gt;Example Ajax Content&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After the response is rendered in the parent Ajax Panel <code>div</code> the full dom structure will look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;ajax-panel&quot; data-url=&quot;http://domain.tld/ajax-panel-controller&quot; data-id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;Example Ajax Content&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Ajax Panel Plugins</h2>

<p>After we build our first views we run in several problems. The biggest problem was, that we want to use jQuery in the
response's rendered content. We decided to develop an own plugin loader for our ajax panel which loads automatically
JavaScript plugins after the panel load. We throw many events for third party plugins that developers can use for their
own plugin. Also the shopware default plugins can be registered in the ajax panel.</p>

<p>To achieve this approach we added an optional <code>data-plugins</code> attribute which can contain multiple JavaScript plugins:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;ajax-panel&quot; data-url=&quot;[..]&quot; data-id=&quot;[..]&quot; data-plugins=&quot;examplePlugin&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Basic Ajax Panel Plugin</h2>

<p>Our JavaScript example plugin code looks like that:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">/**
 * Remove all elements with triggerSelector Class
 */
$.plugin('b2bAjaxPanelExamplePlugin', {
    defaults: {
        triggerSelector: '.should--removed'
    },

    init: function () {
        var me = this;
        me._on(document, 'b2b--ajax-panel_loaded', $.proxy(me.addClasses, me));
    },

    addClasses: function (event, eventData) {
        var $panel = $(eventData.panel);

        $panel
            .find(me.defaults.triggerSelector)
            .remove();
    },

    destroy: function() {
        var me = this;
        me._destroy();
    }
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>With the ajax panel we build a lightweight frontend framework which only depends on jQuery. Shopware delivers jQuery in the
Responsive theme, so we don't need to require any addional component. Awesome, isn't it?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Our Ajax Panel is a complete flexible and lightweight framework with many possibilities and jQuery as a single dependency.
The panel can be handled with simple data attributes and additional plugins allows to use JavaScript plugins.
We use this technology in our B2B-Suite in each module very succesfully.</p>

        <link href="https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/08/24/mutation-testing"/>
        <updated>2017-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/08/24/mutation-testing</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="alert alert-info">
Anyone who is just searching for the example source code and does not want to read the complete blog post, <a href="https://github.com/teiling88/mutation-testing">here it is.</a>
</div>

<p>In this blog post I want to present the concept of mutation testing and a simple example with <a href="https://github.com/humbug/humbug">humbug</a> for you. A few months ago, we have reached the 100 % code coverage goal in our actual project, the <a href="https://docs.enterprise.shopware.com/b2b-suite/">b2b-suite</a>. But what does this number stand for? Yes it <strong><em>only</em></strong> says you created enough unit-tests to execute every single line of code in your application. Nothing more. In the following sections I will create a simple class which is completely covered with unit tests. After that we will improve the tests and show how mutation testing can support us there.</p>

<h2>Create an example class and unit tests</h2>

<p>Let us have a look on this simple comparison example class:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);

class Comparison
{
    public function isGreaterThan(int $x, int $y): bool
    {
        return $x &gt; $y;
    }

    public function isSmallerThan(int $x, int $y): bool
    {
        return $x &lt; $y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To create a unit-test to reach 100 % coverage is very simple. See the example below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);

class ComparisonTest extends PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    private $comparison;

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this-&gt;comparison = new Comparison();
    }

    public function test_isGreaterThan()
    {
        self::assertTrue($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isGreaterThan(5, 3));
    }

    public function test_isSmallerThan()
    {
        self::assertTrue($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isSmallerThan(3, 5));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The execution of these unit tests creates the following output:</p>

<pre><code>OK (2 tests, 2 assertions)


Code Coverage Report:   
  2017-08-22 12:42:16   
                        
 Summary:               
  Classes: 100.00% (1/1)
  Methods: 100.00% (2/2)
  Lines:   100.00% (2/2)

Comparison
  Methods: 100.00% (2/2)   Lines: 100.00% (2/2)

</code></pre>

<p>So we created a class with two methods which are covered by tests. We could think this class is bullet proof and every invalid change will be discovered from our test. But really? What if some developer adds a small equal sign to our methods? Our new <code>Comparison</code> class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);

class Comparison
{
    public function isGreaterThan(int $x, int $y): bool
    {
        return $x &gt;= $y;
    }

    public function isSmallerThan(int $x, int $y): bool
    {
        return $x &lt;= $y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the result of our unit test is the same like above. Every test passed. But now false positive results are possible . If we use the method <code>isGreaterThan</code> with the parameters <code>$x = 5; $y = 5;</code> we will get true as return value instead of the supposed false value.</p>

<p>So what happened? At the moment we only test the happy execution path of these methods and don't observe of the threshold values. For every developer it is obviously that 5 is greater than 3 and 3 is smaller than 5. So we create this kind of test. But how we have to improve our test to cover oll existing threshold values?</p>

<p>First, we should test the nearest combination of parameters which causes an false return value. In our example methods we can easily use the equal number for <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code>. After that we should test the farthest combination which causes a true return value. For this we can easily use the PHP constants <code>PHP_INT_MAX</code> and <code>PHP_INT_MIN</code>. The new created test can be seen below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);

class ComparisonTest extends PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    // ...

    public function test_isGreaterThan()
    {
        self::assertTrue($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isGreaterThan(5, 3));
        self::assertFalse($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isGreaterThan(4, 4));
        self::assertTrue($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isGreaterThan(PHP_INT_MAX, PHP_INT_MIN));
    }

    public function test_isSmallerThan()
    {
        self::assertTrue($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isSmallerThan(3, 5));
        self::assertFalse($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isSmallerThan(4, 4));
        self::assertTrue($this-&gt;comparison-&gt;isSmallerThan(PHP_INT_MIN, PHP_INT_MAX));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Mutation Testing</h2>

<p>In this small example it is very easy to find the needed test range and threshold values. But how does it work in bigger applications with hundred of classes and thousand lines of code? I guess in the most cases only the happy path will be tested. So how can mutation testing help us to create better tests?</p>

<p>The basic concept of mutation testing sounds very easy. You change comparison statements as an example from <code>===</code> to <code>!==</code> or changes return values of methods like <code>return true;</code> to <code>return false;</code>. This new versions of your application are called &quot;mutants&quot;. After your change you execute the test suite. If the suite fails your tests &quot;killed the mutant&quot;. This means your tests detected the wrong behaviour.</p>

<p>Mutation testing introduces a new quality score the so-called &quot;Mutation Score Indicator&quot;. This score is the ratio of the number of Dead Mutants over all created Mutants. Usually this score is calculated like the code coverage in percent.</p>

<p>In order to make this kind of testing automatically we can use <a href="https://github.com/humbug/humbug">humbug</a> for that. Humbug has a wide range of mutators like the described mutations above. A good overview can be found <a href="https://github.com/humbug/humbug#mutators">here</a>.</p>

<p>So let us revert the new assertions and execute humbug for the first time. Humbug executes phpunit in the first place. After that it will create the mutants and execute the test suite again for every created mutant. To improve the execution time humbug only uses those test classes which cover the specific file and line on which the mutation was inserted.</p>

<p>Humbug creates the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Humbug has completed the initial test run successfully.
Tests: 2 Line Coverage: 100.00%

Humbug is analysing source files...

Mutation Testing is commencing on 1 files...
(.: killed, M: escaped, S: uncovered, E: fatal error, T: timed out)

M.M.

4 mutations were generated:
       2 mutants were killed
       0 mutants were not covered by tests
       2 covered mutants were not detected
       0 fatal errors were encountered
       0 time outs were encountered

Metrics:
    Mutation Score Indicator (MSI): 50%
    Mutation Code Coverage: 100%
    Covered Code MSI: 50%
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, humbug created 4 mutations, 2 mutants were killed and 2 mutants were not detected. So let us have a look at the generated mutations which are not detected:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">    public function isGreaterThan(int $x, int $y): bool
    {
        return $x &gt;= $y;
    }
    
    public function isSmallerThan(int $x, int $y): bool
    {
        return $x &lt;= $y;
    }    
</code></pre>

<p>Humbug automatically detects the same issues which we found above manually. If we add the new assertions which we already created above we should reach an Mutation Score Indicator of 100%. The created output stands below:</p>

<pre><code>Humbug has completed the initial test run successfully.
Tests: 2 Line Coverage: 100.00%

Humbug is analysing source files...

Mutation Testing is commencing on 1 files...
(.: killed, M: escaped, S: uncovered, E: fatal error, T: timed out)

....

4 mutations were generated:
       4 mutants were killed
       0 mutants were not covered by tests
       0 covered mutants were not detected
       0 fatal errors were encountered
       0 time outs were encountered

Metrics:
    Mutation Score Indicator (MSI): 100%
    Mutation Code Coverage: 100%
    Covered Code MSI: 100%
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mutation Testing especially humbug is a powerful tool to rate the quality of your unit tests. It checks the hole test suite and gives you the safety that your created tests are useful. Our b2b-suite has at the moment a Mutation Score Indicator of 79%. So I think there is some space left for improvements ;-).</p>

<p><em>Custom font example in the Shopware storefront</em></p>

<p>Lately we're getting more &amp; more requests on how to register / add custom fonts to the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor in the Shopware administration. The editor is used throughout every Shopware module where you can insert HTML text, therefore it would be handy to have your own fonts in there.</p>

<p>We've created an open source Shopware plugin called <code>SwagTinyMceCustomFont</code> which covers your needs. It allows you to integrate custom fonts from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. The plugin automatically loads the font in the administration interface as well as in the storefront of your shop.</p>

<p>You can find the plugin as well as the feature overview, installation guide and usage example on GitHub on: <a href="https://github.com/shopwareLabs/SwagTinyMceCustomFont">https://github.com/shopwareLabs/SwagTinyMceCustomFont</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the world of eCommerce, SEO is a very important and recurrent topic.
Thus, Shopware offers some tools to create a SEO friendly shop by default, including SEO friendly URLs.
Make sure to have a look at the following SEO blog post, covering detailed information for the Shopware SEO engine: <a href="/blog/2015/08/11/the-shopware-seo-engine/">The Shopware SEO engine</a></p>

<p>But for now, how do we actually create proper SEO URLs for our custom plugins?</p>

<p>It must have been about a year ago when I stumbled across the same issue while reworking our premium plugin
<a href="http://store.shopware.com/en/swagproductadvisor/shopping-advisor.html">Shopping advisor</a>.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I want to provide a short tutorial on how to implement custom SEO URLs for your plugins.
I'll also attach an example plugin for both Shopware 5.3 and 5.2 at the end of the tutorial.</p>

<h2>Generating a SEO URL for a custom controller</h2>

<p>For this short tutorial I will use a very basic plugin based on the new plugin system.</p>

<h3>The scenario</h3>

<p>As an example, I would like to create a glossary plugin.</p>

<p>Using the glossary plugin, the shop owner should be able to create a description for a word.
The plugin will provide an overview, showing all given words and their description.</p>

<p>To store those, I created a table with the name <code>s_glossary</code> and the columns <code>id</code>, <code>word</code> and <code>description</code>.</p>

<p>Later in this tutorial we also want to add a detail page, only showing a given word and its respective description.</p>

<p>Let's assume the basic plugin structure contains a registered Frontend controller called <code>Glossary</code>, as well as the mentioned
database table.</p>

<h3>Let's get started</h3>

<p>For the glossary overview, we would implement an <code>indexAction</code> in our <code>Glossary</code> controller to handle the overview.
In order to call our action now, we'd open the following URL: <code>http://myShop.com/glossary/</code></p>

<p>That URL looks smooth and SEO friendly already, doesn't it?</p>

<p>What happens, if we want the glossary page to be internationally available?
For your german customers, you would want the glossary to be available using <code>http://myShop.com/glossar/</code> as well.</p>

<p>This can and should be done using SEO URLs.</p>

<p>First of all, SEO URLs in Shopware are stored in the database table <code>s_core_rewrite_urls</code>.
We could just create a new entry in that table during the installation process of the plugin.
That would actually work for now.</p>

<p>Yet, we want to create those SEO URLs depending on the 'refresh strategies' configuration.</p>

<p>This configuration can be found in the backend: <code>Configuration &gt; Cache/performance &gt; Settings &gt; SEO &gt; Refresh strategy</code>.
Our SEO URLs are generated in three different ways, being configurable in the backend.</p>

<p>Available options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manually</li>
<li>Via cronjob</li>
<li>Live</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, refer to this blog post to get more detailed information on how those work: <a href="/blog/2015/08/11/the-shopware-seo-engine/">The Shopware SEO engine</a></p>

<p>As each of the options mentioned above requires slightly different plugin logic, I'll explain them step by step.</p>

<h3>Implement logic for 'Via cronjob'</h3>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="error">
    The following code is only compatible with Shopware version 5.3 or higher.
</div>

<p>In <strong>Shopware 5.3</strong> we implemented a new event to SEO URL generation using the cronjob. <br />
Everytime the cronjob <code>RefreshSeoIndex</code> is triggered, the method <code>onRefreshSeoIndex</code> in <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.3/engine/Shopware/Plugins/Default/Core/RebuildIndex/Bootstrap.php#L134">engine/Shopware/Plugins/Default/Core/RebuildIndex/Bootstrap.php</a> is called. <br />
It now contains a new notify event called <code>Shopware_CronJob_RefreshSeoIndex_CreateRewriteTable</code>, which we will use to add our own SEO URL generation process.
The event is called once for each shop after every other SEO URL (e.g. Products, Categories, ...) has been generated for this shop.</p>

<pre><code>public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    return [
        'Shopware_CronJob_RefreshSeoIndex_CreateRewriteTable' =&gt; 'createGlossaryRewriteTable'
    ];
}

public function createGlossaryRewriteTable()
{
    /** @var \sRewriteTable $rewriteTableModule */
    $rewriteTableModule = Shopware()-&gt;Container()-&gt;get('modules')-&gt;sRewriteTable();
    
    // Insert new rewrite URL for our custom controller
    $rewriteTableModule-&gt;sInsertUrl('sViewport=glossary', 'glossary/');
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example mentioned above, we would create a new rewrite URL for each shop.
Of course, in this code we could and should now build our logic to create the translated rewrite URLs, e.g. <code>http://myShop.com/glossar</code>, which would be the german translation for it.</p>

<h3>Implement logic for 'Live'</h3>

<p>This option does <strong>not</strong> mean, that with each and every request the SEO URLs are re-generated.
You can configure the refresh interval in the backend under <code>Configuration &gt; Cache/performance &gt; Settings &gt; SEO &gt; Refresh strategy</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, whenever a request is sent to the shop and the response is about to be sent back, Shopware checks if it's time to re-generate the SEO URLs.
In only that case (refresh strategy is 'live' AND the interval has passed), the method <code>sCreateRewriteTable</code> from our core module <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.3/engine/Shopware/Core/sRewriteTable.php#L220">sRewriteTable</a> is called.</p>

<p>This method only generates the SEO URLs for the <strong>currently</strong> active shop.</p>

<p>Therefore we could use an after hook on the method mentioned above.
The code to actually insert our URL into the database is the same, so we can just re-use the same code with a different event.</p>

<pre><code>public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    return [
        'Shopware_CronJob_RefreshSeoIndex_CreateRewriteTable' =&gt; 'createGlossaryRewriteTable',
        'sRewriteTable::sCreateRewriteTable::after' =&gt; 'createGlossaryRewriteTable',
    ];
}

public function createGlossaryRewriteTable()
{
    /** @var \sRewriteTable $rewriteTableModule */
    $rewriteTableModule = Shopware()-&gt;Container()-&gt;get('modules')-&gt;sRewriteTable();
    $rewriteTableModule-&gt;sInsertUrl('sViewport=glossary', 'glossary/');
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it for the live mode.</p>

<h3>Implement logic for 'Manual'</h3>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="error">
    The following code is only compatible with Shopware version 5.3 or higher.
</div>

<div class="is-float-right">
    <img alt="Overview of the SEO URL concept" src="/blog/img/manual-seo-generation-win.png">
    <div><em>The manual SEO URL generation window</em></div>
</div>

<p>This is where things become a little tricky.
The manual URL generation is actually handled in ExtJs, generating the URLs in a batch mode.</p>

<p>You can choose a batch size, which defines how many URLs should be generated with each request.</p>

<p>We want to have our own progress bar at the bottom of the window now to generate our SEO URLs for the currently selected shop in batch mode.</p>

<p>First of all we have to extend the file <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.3/themes/Backend/ExtJs/backend/performance/view/main/multi_request_tasks.js#L83">themes/Backend/ExtJs/backend/performance/view/main/multi_request_tasks.js</a>.
We have to extend the property 'seo', which contains all progress bars, their snippets and, most important, the request URL to be called for each batch call to generate the SEO URLs.</p>

<p>So, let's overwrite the ExtJs window.
I won't go into detail on how to extend an ExtJs file. Refer to this guide about <a href="/developers-guide/backend-extension/#example-#1:-simple-extension">extending the backend</a> instead.</p>

<p><em>Register new event:</em></p>

<pre><code>public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    return [
        ...
        'Enlight_Controller_Action_PostDispatch_Backend_Performance' =&gt; 'loadPerformanceExtension'
    ];
}
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>The respective listener:</em></p>

<pre><code>public function loadPerformanceExtension(\Enlight_Controller_ActionEventArgs $args)
{
    $subject = $args-&gt;getSubject();
    $request = $subject-&gt;Request();

    if ($request-&gt;getActionName() !== 'load') {
        return;
    }

    $subject-&gt;View()-&gt;addTemplateDir(__DIR__ . '/Resources/views/');
    $subject-&gt;View()-&gt;extendsTemplate('backend/performance/view/glossary.js');
}
</code></pre>

<p>With Shopware 5.3 we implemented a new method called <code>addProgressBar</code> to <code>multi_request_tasks.js</code>.
As the first parameter you have to provide an object containing an 'initialText' to be shown initially, a 'progressText' to be shown while generating the SEO URLs
and a 'requestUrl' to be called with each step in the batch processing.
The second parameter has to be a name for the new progress bar - we need this one later.
The third parameter should be the target. Possible values are 'seo' and 'httpCache'. As we want to create a new progress bar to the SEO window, we'll use 'seo' here obviously.</p>

<pre><code>//{block name=&quot;backend/performance/view/main/multi_request_tasks&quot; append}
Ext.define('Shopware.apps.Performance.view.main.Glossary', {
    override: 'Shopware.apps.Performance.view.main.MultiRequestTasks',

    initComponent: function() {
        this.addProgressBar(
            {
                initialText: 'Glossary URLs',
                progressText: '[0] of [1] glossary URLs',
                requestUrl: '{url controller=glossary action=generateSeoUrl}'
            },
            'glossary',
            'seo'
        );

        this.callParent(arguments);
    }
});
//{/block}
</code></pre>

<p>Once we refresh the backend and probably clear the cache, the SEO window should now contain our new progress bar.
Now we need to create our backend controller and a <code>generateSeoUrlAction</code>.</p>

<p>With each AJAX request for the batch processing, we'll get a shopId, an offset and a limit to properly generate our SEO URLs.
We can ignore offset and the limit <strong>for the moment</strong>, since there is only a single URL to be generated for each shop.
Just remember them for later in this tutorial.</p>

<p><em>Controllers/Backend/Glossary.php</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class Shopware_Controllers_Backend_Glossary extends Shopware_Controllers_Backend_ExtJs
{
    public function generateSeoUrlAction()
    {
        $shopId = $this-&gt;Request()-&gt;getParam('shopId');

        /** @var Shopware_Components_SeoIndex $seoIndex */
        $seoIndex = $this-&gt;container-&gt;get('SeoIndex');
        $seoIndex-&gt;registerShop($shopId);

        /** @var sRewriteTable $rewriteTableModule */
        $rewriteTableModule = $this-&gt;container-&gt;get('modules')-&gt;RewriteTable();
        $rewriteTableModule-&gt;baseSetup();
        $rewriteTableModule-&gt;sInsertUrl('sViewport=glossary', 'glossary/');

        $this-&gt;View()-&gt;assign(['success' =&gt; true]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We're fetching the shopId, register a shop using the given shopId and then simply insert our rewrite URL again.</p>

<p>Now there's one more thing missing.
Once we select a shop in the backend SEO module, an AJAX call is sent to collect the total counts of URLs to be created with each progress bar.
Our glossary URLs are not collected yet, so the module can't handle our glossary URLs properly yet.</p>

<p>To collect the URLs, the <code>getCountAction</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.3/engine/Shopware/Plugins/Default/Core/RebuildIndex/Controllers/Seo.php#L72">SEO controller</a> is called.
Thankfully it provides a filter event <code>Shopware_Controllers_Seo_filterCounts</code> to properly add our own counts. For this we need to use the name we used earlier for the progress bar.</p>

<pre><code>public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    return [
        ...
        'Shopware_Controllers_Seo_filterCounts' =&gt; 'addGlossaryCount'
    ];
}

public function addGlossaryCount(\Enlight_Event_EventArgs $args)
{
    $counts = $args-&gt;getReturn();

    $counts['glossary'] = 1;

    return $counts;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, there's only a single URL to be generated for each shop, so we'll just return a static 1.</p>

<p>So, now let's try it.
If you've implemented everything properly, it should work perfectly now.</p>

<h2>Custom parameters in SEO URL</h2>

<p>Now we've implemented a simple SEO URL generation for our glossary plugin.
The overview is now supported by SEO friendly URLs and we even generate those URLs in a proper way, depending on the given configuration.</p>

<p>Now we want to have some kind of &quot;detail&quot; page for each word.
When calling this detailed page, we only see a single word with its related description.</p>

<p>For this we need a new action in our <strong>Frontend</strong> Controller, e.g. &quot;detailAction&quot;.
We could call this action by using an URL like <code>http://myShop.com/glossary/detail</code>.
In this case though, we would have to attach an ID for the word we want to show now.</p>

<p>Sounds easy, let's just attach it to the URL:
<code>http://myShop.com/glossary/detail?wordId=1</code></p>

<p>This link would now display the word with the ID 1.
Wouldn't it be cooler to have the word itself as a part of the URL now?
E.g. you'd want to explain the word 'recursion', then the URL could look like this: <code>http://myShop.com/glossary/recursion</code></p>

<p>Way better, isn't it?</p>

<p>Now this already requires several changes in our code.
First of all, every time we generate our SEO URLs, we have to iterate through all words in our database.</p>

<pre><code>public function createGlossaryRewriteTable()
{
    /** @var \sRewriteTable $rewriteTableModule */
    $rewriteTableModule = Shopware()-&gt;Container()-&gt;get('modules')-&gt;sRewriteTable();
    $rewriteTableModule-&gt;sInsertUrl('sViewport=glossary', 'glossary/');

    /** @var QueryBuilder $dbalQueryBuilder */
    $dbalQueryBuilder = $this-&gt;container-&gt;get('dbal_connection')-&gt;createQueryBuilder();

    $words = $dbalQueryBuilder-&gt;select('glossary.id, glossary.word')
        -&gt;from('s_glossary', 'glossary')
        -&gt;execute()
        -&gt;fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR);

    foreach ($words as $wordId =&gt; $word) {
        $rewriteTableModule-&gt;sInsertUrl('sViewport=glossary&amp;sAction=detail&amp;wordId=' . $wordId, 'glossary/' . $word);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, we need to adjust the URL counts for the backend now.</p>

<pre><code>public function addGlossaryCount(\Enlight_Event_EventArgs $args)
{
    $counts = $args-&gt;getReturn();

    /** @var QueryBuilder $dbalQueryBuilder */
    $dbalQueryBuilder = $this-&gt;container-&gt;get('dbal_connection')-&gt;createQueryBuilder();
    $wordsCount = $dbalQueryBuilder-&gt;select('COUNT(glossary.id)')
        -&gt;from('s_glossary', 'glossary')
        -&gt;execute()
        -&gt;fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_COLUMN);

    $counts['glossary'] = $wordsCount;

    return $counts;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do you still remember the <code>offset</code> and the <code>limit</code> parameter from the batch processing for the SEO URLs?
Now we do have to implement those, to only generate as many SEO URLs as configured in the batch process.</p>

<pre><code>public function generateSeoUrlAction()
{
    ...

    /** @var QueryBuilder $dbalQueryBuilder */
    $dbalQueryBuilder = $this-&gt;container-&gt;get('dbal_connection')-&gt;createQueryBuilder();
    $words = $dbalQueryBuilder-&gt;select('glossary.id, glossary.word')
        -&gt;from('s_glossary', 'glossary')
        -&gt;setMaxResults($limit)
        -&gt;setFirstResult($offset)
        -&gt;execute()
        -&gt;fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR);

    foreach ($words as $wordId =&gt; $word) {
        $rewriteTableModule-&gt;sInsertUrl('sViewport=glossary&amp;sAction=detail&amp;wordId=' . $wordId, 'glossary/' . $word);
    }

    $this-&gt;View()-&gt;assign(['success' =&gt; true]);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Add foreign parameters</h3>

<p>While this already looks good, there's one more thing to do.
Shopware needs to know our custom parameter &quot;<strong>wordId</strong>&quot; first.
Otherwise our parameter would just get stripped and our SEO URL wouldn't work.</p>

<p>The possible cases for parameters are handled in the <a href="https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.3/engine/Shopware/Components/Routing/Generators/RewriteGenerator.php#L166">RewriteGenerator</a>.
It has a whole lot of cases, e.g. the parameter &quot;<strong>sArticle</strong>&quot; is only allowed when used with the <strong>detail</strong> controller.</p>

<p>Thankfully, since Shopware 5.2, this method provides an event to add custom parameters.</p>

<p>So, let's add the event and implement our custom parameter.</p>

<pre><code>public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    return [
        ...
        'Shopware_Components_RewriteGenerator_FilterQuery' =&gt; 'filterParameterQuery'
    ];
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>public function filterParameterQuery(\Enlight_Event_EventArgs $args)
{
    $orgQuery = $args-&gt;getReturn();
    $query = $args-&gt;getQuery();

    if ($query['controller'] === 'glossary' &amp;&amp; isset($query['wordId'])) {
        $orgQuery['wordId'] = $query['wordId'];
    }

    return $orgQuery;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, what did I do here?
First of all, Shopware doesn't know things like &quot;controllers&quot; or &quot;actions&quot; like that.
Due to legacy reasons, Shopware still needs them to be handled as 'sViewport', which would be the controller, and 'sAction',
which obviously represents action.
That's what <code>$orgQuery</code> contains: The controller mapped to 'sViewport' and the action mapped to the array element 'sAction'.
Since <code>$orgQuery</code> will be used for assembling our SEO URL later, we need to add our parameter to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <code>$query</code> contains the actual request parameters as we know them.</p>

<p>We only need to add our custom parameter <code>wordId</code> if both the controller equals 'glossary' and the parameter itself is set.
In that case, we add <code>wordId</code> to <code>$orgQuery</code> and return it afterwards.</p>

<h2>Example plugin</h2>

<p>You can find the example plugin for <strong>Shopware 5.3</strong> <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/exampleplugins/SeoExample.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>Just to make sure: <strong>This is not a fully functional plugin as it is only supposed to be an example.</strong>
It will create the necessary plugin table <em>s_glossary</em> with a few example words.
This plugin does not provide a backend module to work with and the frontend templates are very slim to show the basic functionality.</p>

<h3>Shopware 5.2 plugin</h3>

<p>We've also created an example plugin for <strong>Shopware 5.2</strong>, which can be found <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/exampleplugins/SeoExample52.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>There's several differences, e.g. the whole <em>Resources/views/backend</em> directory is different.
Additional to that, the logic to count the available glossary URLs had to be changed, since the event we used above was implemented with 5.3.</p>

        <link href="https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/06/26/quick-tip-shopping-worlds-without-ajax"/>
        <updated>2017-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/06/26/quick-tip-shopping-worlds-without-ajax</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we're back with a short &amp; simple tip which allows you to load shopping worlds at any place in your store front without the need of loading them using AJAX. Do to so, please create your own frontend theme, if you haven't one in place already. Please refer to our <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/designers-guide/getting-started/#custom-themes">Templating Getting Started Guide</a> on how to create your own custom theme.</p>

<p>After creating your own theme, please create a new JavaScript file in your <code>_public/src/js</code> directory &amp; place the following content into it:</p>

<pre><code>window.StateManager
    .removePlugin('.emotion--wrapper', 'swEmotionLoader')
    .addPlugin('.emotion--wrapper:not(.emotion--non-ajax)', 'swEmotionLoader')
    .addPlugin('.emotion--non-ajax *[data-emotion=&quot;true&quot;]', 'swEmotion');
</code></pre>

<p>We're removing the <code>swEmotionLoader</code> jQuery plugin which is the entry point for an AJAX shopping world. We're removing it because we have to modify the selector for the jQuery plugin. In the next line we're adding the same plugin but with a different selector. The selector allows us to add the class <code>emotion--non-ajax</code> to the element which should contain the shopping world later on. Last but not least, we're adding the jQuery plugin <code>swEmotion</code> to the plugin queue with our <code>emotion--non-ajax</code> class in place.</p>

<p>After you've added the content to the JavaScript file, make sure you've registered the file in the <code>$javascript</code> array in your <code>Theme.php</code> file. If you need further information, please head over to our <a href="https://developers.shopware.com/designers-guide/css-and-js-files-usage/#add-javascript-files">CSS &amp; JS Files Usage Guide</a>.</p>

<p>With these changes in place, you're now able to include shopping worlds literally at any place in your store front with the following code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;emotion--wrapper emotion--non-ajax&quot;&gt;
    {action module=&quot;widgets&quot; controller=&quot;emotion&quot; action=&quot;index&quot; emotionId=&quot;7&quot;}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The argument <code>emotionId</code> in the widget call lets you choose what shopping world you would like to include. To get an overview of all available shopping worlds, please refer to the <code>s_core_emotion</code> database table.</p>

<p>You may have to customize the styling of the shopping world, depending on what section of the store front you're using it.</p>

        <link href="https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/02/06/currency-formatting-is-easy-isnt-it"/>
        <updated>2017-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://developers.shopware.com/blog/2017/02/06/currency-formatting-is-easy-isnt-it</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled across a quite common problem in eCommerce projects I would like to cover in this blog post. According to a
popular saying &quot;Money is what makes the world go round&quot; do we have to deal with currencies all the time especially in an application with heavy
client side processing and templating. You're always using a formatter or helper methods in some way or another to deal with currencies. All
of these solutions are not feeling right.</p>

<h3>What's the problem anyways?</h3>

<p>Let's take a look at one of those functions to get a feeling for the situation we're facing. One of the simplest ways
is to have a function like this in place:</p>

<pre><code>function formatCurrency (val) {
    return val.toString().replace('.', ',') + ' €';
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Very simple example for a currency formatter function</em></p>

<p>As you can tell already, it just covers one specific currency format. If we're dealing with prices in any other currency
like USD for example, the helper fails miserably. So what we can do is extend the method to provide us with the ability
to support multiple currencies?</p>

<pre><code>function formatCurrency (val, currency) {
    var currencyFormat;
    
    val = (Math.round(val * 100) / 100).toFixed(2);
    
    switch (currency) {
        case 'USD':
            currencyFormat = '$ 0.00';
            val = currencyFormat.replace('0.00', val);
            break;
        case 'EUR':
            currencyFormat = '0,00 €';
            val = value.replace('.', ',');
            val = currencyFormat.replace('0,00', val);
            break;
        default:
            throw new Error('Unknown currency format');
            break;
    }
    return val;
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>More enhanced formatter helper - still with issues</em></p>

<p>Now let us take a closer look on the example above. As you can see we're supporting two currency formats (EUR and USD) now,
which is an enhancement compared to the very simple formatter we saw before but it is still far away from being perfect. Why you may asking?
What happens when our customer wants a shop in the UK? We would have to implement another currency format
in our helper. The solution is very limited regarding to the supported formats &amp; currencies. The code isn't tested in-depth
and we want a solution which can cover all available currency formats. So let us sum up the con's / problems:</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Dealing with currency formatting on your own is a pain and not recommended</li>
<li>You have to support a bunch of formats and currencies (~ 270 currencies)</li>
<li>Workarounds are necessary to get a somewhat working solution with limitations</li>
<li>The code isn't tested in-depth in different browsers with all the available currency formats</li>
</ul>

<p>What you really want is a Native Browser API which is defined in an ECMAScript specification.</p>

<h3><code>Number.toLocaleString</code> Native Method</h3>

<p>In December 2012, ECMA International published the first edition of ECMA-402, better known as the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/">ECMA
Internationalization API Specification 1.0</a>. This specification
describes an API to bring long overdue localization methods to ECMAScript implementations.</p>

<p>First I stumbled across <code>Number.toLocaleString()</code> in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. It
provides you with the ability to format numbers language sensitive.</p>

<pre><code>var num = 3500.99;
num.toLocaleString();
</code></pre>

<p><iframe src="https://jsfiddle.net/klarstil/rkttsyyn/embedded/result/" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="150px"></iframe></p>

<p>If we're taking the example a little bit further and using the <code>language</code> &amp; <code>options</code> arguments, we can format the number
as a currency and format the number the way we want.</p>

<pre><code>var num = 3500.99;
num.toLocaleString('de-DE', {
   style: 'currency',
   currency: 'EUR',
   currencyDisplay: 'name',
   useGrouping: true
});
</code></pre>

<p><iframe src="https://jsfiddle.net/klarstil/mvL6eu7c/embedded/result/" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="150px"></iframe></p>

<h3><code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> Native API</h3>

<p>The <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> object is a constructor for objects that enables language sensitive number formatting. This is a
great solution for the day-by-day problem we're facing with currency formatting. Especially the <code>options</code> properties <code>currency</code> and
<code>currencyDisplay</code> are very interesting for our use case. Before we're deep diving into the functionality and
ability of the API I would like to take a closer look on the compatibility:</p>

<p><iframe src="//caniuse.bitsofco.de/embed/index.html?feat=internationalization&amp;periods=future_1,current,past_1,past_2" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="390px"></iframe></p>

<p>If your target browser doesn't support the International API specification, there's always a polyfill available on github.
This is the case for the <code>Intl</code> Native API as well: <a href="https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/">andyearnshaw/Intl.js/</a>.</p>

<p>Let us take a closer look on how to use the Native API, shall we?</p>

<pre><code>new Intl.NumberFormat([locales[, options]]);
</code></pre>

<p><em>Syntax for <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code></em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>locales</code> - Optional argument. A string or an array with a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">BCP 47</a> language tag.
If you omit the parameter the browser's locale will be used.</li>
<li>
<code>options</code> - Optional argument. An object with the following properties:
<ul>
<li>
<code>localeMatcher</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>currency</code>, <code>currencyDisplay</code>, <code>useGrouping</code>, <code>minimumIntegerDigits</code>, <code>minimumFractionDigits</code>, <code>maximumFractionDigits</code>, <code>minimumSignificantDigits</code> &amp; <code>maximumSignificantDigits</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For our use case the 3 most important properties inside the <code>options</code> object are: <code>style</code>, <code>currency</code>, <code>currencyDisplay</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>style</code> - Defines the style to use for the number formatting. <code>decimal</code> for plain number formatting, <code>currency</code> for
currency formatting &amp; <code>percent</code> for percent formatting.</li>
<li>
<code>currency</code> - The currency to use for currency formatting. Possible values are the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/currency_codes.htm">ISO 4217</a>
currency codes, such as &quot;USD&quot; for the US dollar, &quot;EUR&quot; for the euro or &quot;GBP&quot; for british pound.</li>
<li>
<code>currencyDisplay</code> - How to display the currency. Possible values are <code>symbol</code> for a localized symbol of the currency,
<code>code</code> to use the ISO currency code or <code>name</code> to use for a localized string of the currency.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>var number = 123456.789;

// request a currency format
console.log(new Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE', { style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR' }).format(number));
// 23.456,79 €

// the Japanese yen doesn't use a minor unit
console.log(new Intl.NumberFormat('ja-JP', { style: 'currency', currency: 'JPY' }).format(number));
// ￥123,457
</code></pre>

<p><em>Examples on how to use <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code></em></p>

<h4>Feature detection</h4>

<p>It always comes in handy to know how to detect a certain feature you want to use.</p>

<pre><code>var toLocaleStringSupportsOptions = function() {
    return (typeof Intl == 'object' &amp;&amp; Intl &amp;&amp; typeof Intl.NumberFormat == 'function');
};
</code></pre>

<h3>Performance matters</h3>

<p>After playing around with both approaches, I noticed a quite heavy downside of <code>Number.toLocaleString()</code>. It became a
performance bottleneck with huge data sets. To back up my assumption I've created a benchmark to compare both approaches
and get a number about the operations per second.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the statistics I would like to show off the two approaches we're comparing here:</p>

<p><strong>Number.toLocaleString()</strong></p>

<pre><code>var opts = { style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR' };
12.49.toLocaleString('de-DE', opts);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Intl.NumberFormat.format()</strong></p>

<pre><code>var opts = { style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR' },
    numberFormat = new Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE', opts);

numberFormat.format(12.49)
</code></pre>

<p>Without further ado here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/stats-currency-formatting.png" alt="Comparison Number.toLocaleString vs. Intl.NumberFormat.format()" /></p>

<p>I highlighted the results of Chrome 58.0.2991, so we can take a closer look on the results.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome 58.0.2991:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Number.toLocaleString()</code> - 7,421 operations per second</li>
<li>
<code>Intl.NumberFormat.format()</code> - 1,659,696 operations per second</li>
</ul>

<p>The other results which I like to point out are the results from Mobile Safari. The benchmark was performed on an iPhone 7 Plus.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Safari 10.0:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Number.toLocaleString()</code> - 12,683 operations per second</li>
<li>
<code>Intl.NumberFormat.format()</code> - 2,125,766 operations per second</li>
</ul>

<p>Hands down, Mobile Safari is by far the fastest browser regarding the <code>Intl</code> Native API which I found pretty impressive.
On the other hand we tested Chrome Mobile on a Samsung Galaxy S7 with very poor results:</p>

<p><strong>Chrome Mobile 55.0.1882</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Number.toLocaleString()</code> - 3,230 operations per second</li>
<li>
<code>Intl.NumberFormat.format()</code> - 265,300 operations per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Native API <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> is perfect for heavy client side applications which are dealing with huge data sets
and it is convenient to use. A helper function which uses the API can look like the following code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>function NumberFormatter(locale, opts) {
    var formatNumber,
        defaults = {
            style: 'currency',
            currency: 'EUR'
        };
    opts = opts || {};
    opts = Object.assign({}, defaults, opts);
    
    formatNumber = new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, opts);
    return formatNumber.format;
};

var formatter = new NumberFormatter('de-DE');
console.log(formatter(12.49));
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Intl</code> API comes with a bunch of other methods for internationalization purposes such as language specific date
formatting.</p>
